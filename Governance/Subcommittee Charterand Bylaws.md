AAVLD/USAHA Subcommittee on Information Standards
Charter and Bylaws
```
**Purpose:**
The subcommittee has been created to deal with the needs of the animal health community to
efficiently exchange information between information systems and services.

**Scope of Activities:**
The subcommittee will endeavor to develop, or adopt existing, standards for information
interchange by systems and services related to regulatory veterinary medicine as requested by its
parent committee, the executive committees of either AAVLD or USAHA, or the National Assembly of
State Animal Health Officials. Standards developed and/or adopted by the subcommittee will
address the external exchange of information between systems, not with the internal representation
of that information nor the user interface(s) exposed by any compliant system(s).

**Scope of Standards Developed:**
Each standard developed by the subcommittee will have a clear and concise statement of its scope.
Each scope statement will be voted on by consensus prior to official subcommittee work commencing
on the standard. Aspects of animal health software and services not explicitly in scope are left to
implementers. The standards will be interchange standards for encapsulating the data exchanged.
Eligible reference lists or comparable definitions of data concept domains will be included as part of
the standards when necessary to facilitate the exchange.

**Leadership:**
The subcommittee will have two co-chairs. One co-chair will be from the public sector and one from
the private sector. Co-chairs will be nominated from the subcommittee membership and elected by
simple majority vote. The term of each co-chair will be two years. (Initially one co-chair will be
selected at random to serve a one-year term.) Co-chairs may be re-elected indefinitely. At least one
co-chair must be present to conduct formal decision making.

**Membership:**
Members provide expertise on various aspects of animal health information systems. Membership is
balanced between producers of animal health software and services and consumers of the same,
mainly state and federal regulatory agencies. Additional members provide specialized knowledge of
the standards and regulatory domains. Members are appointed by the Chair of the AAVLD/USAHA
Committee on Animal Health Surveillance and Information Systems. Nominations to the subcommittee will seek balanced representation of four categories: Federal Government, State
Government, Industry, and Academia. Other representation may include sister organizations, etc.
Subcommittee members must be members of the AAVLD/USAHA Committee on Animal Health
Surveillance and Information Systems. AAVLD or USAHA members nominated to the subcommittee
who are not members of the full committee may be appointed by their respective Presidents as
described in the USAHA bylaws (9.5) and AAVLD bylaws (VIII Section 1). In some cases non
AAVLD/USAHA members, e.g. technical consultants, may be appointed as non-voting members of the
Animal Health Surveillance and Information Systems committee, but may participate and vote as
part of the quorum within this subcommittee.

**Quorum:**
In order to ensure appropriate inclusiveness and balance in the decision making process quorum is
defined as the presence of at least one member of each from Federal Government, State
Government, and Academia. In addition, Industry participation must include representatives of at
least two unrelated commercial companies for a total of five representatives. Representatives of
other groups may contribute to the overall quorum and may vote but do not contribute to the
category balance requirement. Co-chairs may vote and contribute to quorum for their represented
category. The minimum number of voting members to reach a quorum must be eight, five as
described above and an additional three members.

Voting by the quorum is not reached until all members have had adequate notice and time to
consider all decisions, with a minimum number of five working days with initial notification occurring
via email.

**Consensus:**
Subcommittee decisions will be made by consensus ballot. Attendance will be taken and then those
present polled for any objections or abstentions. Decisions may be made by phone if a quorum is
present or may be offered via online poll with quorum determined by votes submitted if necessary.
If _any_ negative votes are cast, the subcommittee must consider these objections and attempt to
reach a resolution. A decision or final product will be considered adopted only when there are no
unresolved negative votes. If the subcommittee concludes that it is impossible to resolve one or
more negative votes, it may vote by simple majority to find those negatives non-persuasive. Such a
decision will automatically be appealed to the full AAVLD/USAHA Committee on Animal Health
Surveillance and Information Systems for final resolution. For actions other than standards, the
decision may be reviewed and approved by the AAVLD/USAHA Animal Health committee chair.


**Prohibited Topics:**
In order to avoid even the appearance of anti-competitive practices, certain topics are will never be
discussed during subcommittee meetings or conference calls. These include product or service
pricing, marketing strategies, and product or service features other than those relating to
information interchange.

**Publication of Standards:**
Standards work products of the subcommittee that have been approved without objection will be
forwarded to the full AAVLD/USAHA Committee on Animal Health Surveillance and Information
Systems as approved draft standards. At the next meeting of the full committee the subcommittee
will report on progress toward adoption and request approval as a final standard.
