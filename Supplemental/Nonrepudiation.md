**Nonrepudiation**

Nonrepudiation refers to a situation in which sufficient evidence exists as to prevent an individual from successfully denying that he or she has made a statement, or taken an action. In information security settings, this can be accomplished in a variety of ways. We may be able to produce proof of the activity directly from system or network logs, or recover such proof through the use of [digital forensic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/digital-forensics) examination of the system or devices involved. We may also be able to establish nonrepudiation through the use of [encryption technologies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/encryption-technology), more specifically through the use of [hash functions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/hash-function) that can be used to digitally sign a communication or a file. We will discuss such methods at considerably greater length in [Chapter 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128007440000051#c0005) when we go over encryption. An example of this might be a system that digitally signs every e-mail that is sent from it, thus rendering useless any denial that might take place regarding the sending of the message in question.
