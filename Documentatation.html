       The eCVI contains the following high-level elements (defined
      separately): Exactly one Veterinarian (see Veterinarian) is required. Exactly one
      MovementPurposes is required (see MovementPurposes, which may actually identify zero
      or more purposes). Exactly one Origin (see PremType) is required. Exactly one
      Destination (see PremType) is required. Exactly one Consignor (see ContactType) is
      optional only if unavailable. Excatly one Consignee (see ContactType) is optional
      only if unavailable. Exactly one Accessions is optional only if unavailable (see
      Accessions, which may actually identify zero or more AccessionTypes). One or more
      Animals (see Animal) are optional only if unavailable. One or more GroupLots (see
      GroupLot) are optional. One or more Attachments (see Attachment) are optional. One
      or more Binaries (see Binary) are optional. CviNumber is a required string.
      IssueDate is a required date. ExpirationDate is a required date. ShipmentDate is an
      optional date. EntryPermitNumber is an optional string. 
      
      
      
      <h2>Element: Veterinarian</h2>
       Within the Veterinarian element: Name (see Person) is required.

      <h2>Element: MovementPurposes</h2>
       Movement Purpose is optional, and there is no limit on additional
      Movement Purposes. Movement Purpose is a bit of a misnomer. It includes mostly
      animal purpose at destination with a little bit of true reason for movement or
      reason for certificate.

      <h2>Element: Accessions</h2>
      Because many herd movements have testing performed in one accession,
      the accession(s) is(are) listed here and referenced by each test rather than \
      duplicating all the accession information for each test on each
      animal.
      
      
      
      <h2>Element: Animal</h2>
       Animal species may be designated by code (see SpeciesCodeType) or
      other (see SpeciesOther Type). A single animal tag (see AnimalTags) is required.
      Test (see TestType) is optional, and there is no limit on additional Tests. Age is
      optional and may be specified as either: a number of days, weeks, months or years
      plus the standard code for units (d|wk|mo|a) (example: 3wk), age definitions adhere
      to UCUM - http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html), or as a specific date of birth as
      a
      four-digit year, two-digit month, and two-digit date, separated by dashes (example:
      2001-05-31). Breed is optional and specified by a two or three uppercase letter code
      or by a string description such as "black". The code list is not specified in the
      standard but most are available at: https://www.naab-css.org/uniform-breed-codes,
      and
      https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/vs_ocio/downloads/date_standards/icvi_data_concepts.pdf.
      Sex (see SexType) is optional. SexDetail is an optional string. InspectionDate is
      a
      required date, and is the date the animals were inspected by the vet. If the
      inspection took place over multiple days, use the first date. 
      
      
      
      <h2>Element: GroupLot</h2>
       Species may be designated by code (see SpeciesCodeType) or other (see
      SpeciesOtherType). Quantity is a required number (decimals acceptable). Unit by
      default is "Number", as in a count. A different unit can be specified as an optional
      string (guidelines on standardized units?). Age is optional and may be specified as
      either: a number of days, weeks, months or years plus the standard code for units
      (d|wk|mo|a) (example: 3wk), age definitions adhere to UCUM -
      http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html), or as a specific date of birth as a four-digit
      year, two-digit month, and two-digit date, separated by dashes (example:
      2001-05-31). Breed is optional and specified by two or three uppercase letters. The
      list is not specified in the standard but most are available at:
      https://www.naab-css.org/uniform-breed-codes, and
      https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/vs_ocio/downloads/date_standards/icvi_data_concepts.pdf.
      Sex (see SexType) is optional. SexDetail is an optional string. Description is
      required (provide more specifics on what should go in here since it is required).
      
      
      
      
      <h2>Element: Statements</h2>
       Additional statements that may be required by various jurisdictions
      may be included here. These statements must not take the place of or modify the
      structured content found elsewhere in the standard.
      
      
      
      <h2>Element: Attachment</h2>
       Attachments can be used for text or binary additional information not
      specifically carried in one of the other Binary elements. Assumed to be from a file
      so Filename is required along with a reference to the Binary content. Be aware that
      receiving applications may ignore unknown or unexpected attachments. The actual
      binary content of the attachment is carried in the Binary element as are any other
      Binary fields. DocType is a required string. (put enumeration values in table
      somehow? Is this list adequate?). Filename is a required string. (Why require a file
      name? many may never have actually resided in a named file.) Comment is an optional
      string. (For what purpose?)
      
      
      <br><b>Scanned Paper CVI: </b>

      forms, or XFA forms. 
      
      
      <br><b>Other: </b>
      All other uses.
      
      
      
      <h2>Element: Binary</h2>
      All binary content is included as Binary and referenced in specific
      elements by ID/IDREF.
      
      
      
      <h2>Element: MiscAttribute</h2>
      Any additional information needed by specific implementations can be
      provided as name/value pairs represented as strings. These data must not be
      essential to proper understanding of the structured content of the standard data but
      only extend it.
      
      
      
      <h2>Element: Person</h2>
       Person is defined as a Name string and an optional Phone Number (see
      Phone). 
      
      
      
      <h2>Element: NameParts</h2>
       NameType defines a structured name for a business or person.
      BusinessName, FirstName, Middle Name, LastName, OtherName are all optional for
      applications to use one or more (zero would validate, but why?) 
      
      
      
      <h2>Element: Phone</h2>
       The Phone Number specifies type (list enumeration values?) and a
      ten-digit number, and can include a comment. 
      
      
      <br><b>Unknown: </b>
      Probably the most common.

      <h2>Element: Accession</h2>
       Accessions are listed for the CVI as a whole and referenced by each
      test. An accession is defined as... A single Laboratory or Field element may be
      specified, indicating where tests for this accession were performed. InfieldTest is
      an optional bool (true/false value) indicating if a test was performed in the field.
      (Is this redundant with the Field element?) ID (see ID) is required, and is the
      reference number that associates an animalâs test details derived from this
      accession (not clear, reword if possible), not the lab accession number. For
      Laboratory accessions: Laboratory is a required, containing the following: LabName
      is a required string. PremId (see PremIdType) is optional only if unavailable.
      Address (see AddressType) is optional only if unavailable and should contain the lab
      (physical? contact?) address. AccessionDate is a required date. AccessionNumber is
      a
      required string. For Field accessions: PremId (see PremIdType) is optional only if
      unavailable. Address (see AddressType) is optional only if unavailable and should
      contain the (physical? contact?) address of the test location. AccessionDate is a
      required date. 
      
      
      
      <h2>Element: ProgramStatus</h2>
      Program status consists of the name of the program and a value
      representing the herd or state (area) status claimed. The enumerated lists need to
      be examined. 
      
      
      
      <h3>Attribute: ProgramStatus:Name</h3>
      The name of the status

      <h3>Attribute: ProgramStatus:Value</h3>
      Only the most common status values are listed.  Others use "other".
      
      
      <br><b>Free: </b>
      Free status for the named disease
      program.
      
      
      <br><b>Modified Accredited: </b>

      <h3>Attribute: ProgramStatus:ValueOther</h3>
      For other status types the value such as Brucellosis stage,
      NPIP clean, may opionally be included in this attribute.
      
      
      
      <h2>Element: Address</h2>
      Origin and destination require a structured address. Because of
      variation in policy between jurisdictions this schema leaves each element optional.
      However for a CVI to be valid in any jurisdiction, this element must contain enough
      information for autorities to uniquely identify the location. 
      
      
      
      <h2>Element: Country</h2>
      Country is restricted to USA by project scope.
      Derivative schemas may expand this list.
      
      
      
      <br><b>USA: </b>
      
      
      
      <h2>Element: coordinates</h2>
      Longitude, Latitude, and Altitude (optional) formatted as
      KML &lt;coordinates&gt; element Longitude (decimal degrees), Latitude
      (decimal degrees) ,Altitude (meters) Example "-122.08220,37.42229,0"
      
      
      
      
      <h2>Element: AddressBlock</h2>
      Contacts such as "consignor, if different", "consignee, if different",
      veterinarian, and carrier may have simple block of text containing more or less
      structured address. 
      
      
      
      <h2>Element: Test</h2>
       Individual test results are included with each animal and reference
      via ID/IDREF an accession. For herd testing this allows one accession with many
      tests. For tests such as Equine Coggins tests that are one per accession it results
      in slight extra overhead. 
      
      
      
      <h2>Element: Result</h2>
      Result may be integer, float or string
      
      
      
      <h3>Attribute: Result:ResultName</h3>
      Results may either be result or comment
      
      
      <br><b>RESULT: </b>
      
      
      <br><b>COMMENT: </b>
      
      
      
      <h3>Attribute: Test:AccessionRef</h3>
       Points to ID in Accession element 
      
      
      
      <h2>Element: SpeciesCode</h2>
       For animals with official species codes, the code is required with
      optional text to add detail if necessary. 
      
      
      
      <h2>Element: SpeciesOther</h2>
       The species coded in the standard include only those commonly needed
      for regulatory action related to the movement. Many other official species codes can
      be found at http://???? Because not all systems may understand these other codes,
      human readable Text is required in addition to the code. For animals without an
      official species code, the code may be omitted the default value is OTH and text
      used to define the actual taxonomy is required.
      
      
      
      <h2>Element: Vaccination</h2>
      Vaccination information for animal or group. For now the type of
      vaccine is left as a simple string. Ideally will become a coded value from a
      standard set. The date is optional but highly suggested. 
      
      
      
      <h2>Element: AnimalTags</h2>
       This is a jumble of type of ID with the type of device holding the
      ID. "Tags" is a misnomer. An ID may be either Known Format matching one of the list
      of regular expressions for common official animal IDs, or some other type, either
      non-offial or one that this schema missed. This field also supports brand
      descriptions, brand images, and equine description or photographs. These can appear
      in any order up to six IDs per animal 
      
      
      
      <h3>Attribute: KnownFormatID:Number</h3>
      KnownFormatID patterns provide some ID
      validation.
      
      
      840 RFID: 840
      followed by 12 digits
      
      
       American ID: USA followed by 12

       Sheep/goat National PIN tag:
      Seven upper case letters or digts (a PIN) + a
      space and one to 20 more upper case letters or
      digits

       Other Formats: No restrictions 
      
      
      
      <h2>Element: BrandImage</h2>
       This should be PNG/JPEG/GIF/PDF format. The format is
      specified in the Binary mime type.
      
      
      
      <h2>Element: EquineDescription</h2>
       Equine registered name is only legal identification
      with description 
      
      
      
      <h2>Element: EquinePhotographs</h2>
